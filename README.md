Multiclass Image Classification (X-ray)
1. Overview
This repository provides a straightforward example of multiclass image classification. The goal of the project is to classify X-ray images into three categories based on lung condition: COVID-19, Viral Pneumonia, and Normal. The dataset used for this task is available on Kaggle. this link of data https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pranavraikokte/covid19-image-dataset
The project leverages the VGG-16 pre-trained model, fine-tuned for this specific classification task, and demonstrates promising results.

2. Model Architecture
The model is based on the VGG-16 architecture, which is pre-trained on ImageNet. To adapt it for this specific task, additional layers were added to the base model. Below is an overview of the modified architecture:

Base Model: VGG-16 (pre-trained on ImageNet, with frozen initial layers).
Additional Layers:
Global Average Pooling Layer
Fully Connected (Dense) Layer with ReLU activation
Dropout Layer for regularization
Output Layer with Softmax activation for multiclass classification
The model was compiled using the Adam optimizer and Categorical Crossentropy as the loss function.

3. Training
The model was trained on the dataset, and the following metrics were recorded during the training process:
Training/Validation Loss: The loss curves indicate that the model converges well, with minimal overfitting.
Training/Validation Accuracy: The accuracy curves show consistent improvement, with the validation accuracy closely following the training accuracy.

4. Results
While accuracy is a common metric for classification tasks, it may not always be the most informative. To better evaluate the model's performance, a confusion matrix was plotted. The results show that the model performs exceptionally well, with only 2 misclassified instances out of the entire test set.
The misclassified images were also visualized to gain insights into potential areas for improvement.

5. Possible Improvements
To further enhance the model's performance, the following strategies can be implemented:

Data Augmentation:
Techniques such as scaling, rotation, flipping, and brightness adjustment can be applied to increase the diversity of the training data and improve generalization.
A code snippet for data augmentation is included in the notebook.

Optimizing F1 Score:
Instead of focusing solely on accuracy, optimizing for the F1 score (which balances precision and recall) can be more effective, especially for imbalanced datasets.
A code snippet for F1 score optimization is provided in the notebook.
Alternative Model Architectures:
Experiment with other pre-trained models such as ResNet, InceptionV3, or EfficientNet to compare performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning:
Perform a grid search or random search to optimize hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and dropout rate.

Class Imbalance Handling:
If the dataset is imbalanced, techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or class weighting can be applied to ensure fair representation of all classes.
Transfer Learning with Fine-Tuning:
Unfreeze and fine-tune some of the deeper layers of the pre-trained model to better adapt it to the specific dataset.
By implementing these improvements, the model's performance can be further enhanced, making it more robust and reliable for real-world applications.
